Vue support for Kakoune

Syntax-highlighting for Vue, with support for pug, scss, sass, less, and typescript within their respective sections.

In order to deal with commenting in different languages, `comment_block_*` is `<!-- -->` for HTML, and `comment_line` is `//` for basically everything else.

Pull requests welcome!
